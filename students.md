<div class="miniblock">
	<img class="headshot" src="images/lukas.jpg"><br />
	<p><strong>Lukas WinklerPrins</strong><br />
	Lukas researches connections between hydrologic conditions, sediment transport, and geomorphology in estuaries. He is particularly interested in the impacts of changing climate and anthropogenic modification. Contrary to his background in mathematics, he loves doing field work. </p>
</div>

<div class="miniblock">
	<img class="headshot" src="images/ann.jpg"><br />
	<p><strong>Ann Scheliga</strong><br />
	Ann's research focuses on large-scale anthropogenic processes impacting terrestrial hydrology. Currently, she is working on comparing modeled and observational contributions to sea-level rise. She is particularly interested in the use of satellite observations to improve groundwater estimates in climate models.</p>
</div>

<div class="miniblock">
	<img class="headshot" src="images/paul.jpg"><br />
	<p><strong>Paul Seibert</strong><br />
	Paul's research focuses on remote sensing data assimilation in the context of ecohydrology. Currently, this takes the form of using TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence data to predict evapotranspiration at a field site in Colorado.</p>
</div>

<div class="miniblock">
	<img class="headshot" src="images/alex.jpg"><br />
	<p><strong>Alexandre Georges</strong><br />
	Alexandre's work focuses on sediment transport, hydrology, remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling to not only track the evolution of mangrove forests in Haiti and the Caribbean, but also study their potential as natural coastal protection infrastructure against sea-level rise. He is also interested in the use of Data Science and Public Policy to tackle the challenge of climate change in the Caribbean region.</p>
</div>

<div class="miniblock">
	<img class="headshot" src="images/lily.jpg"><br />
	<p><strong>Lily Engel</strong><br />
	Lily is interested in how climate change scenarios altering the physics of an estuary will affect the corresponding ecosystem. She uses simplified models to investigate these scenarios with case studies in San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound, and Lake Erie.</p>
