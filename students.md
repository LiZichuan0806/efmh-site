	<strong>Ann Scheliga</strong><br />
	<p>Ann's research focuses on large-scale anthropogenic processes impacting terrestrial hydrology. Currently, she is working on comparing modeled and observational contributions to sea-level rise. She is particularly interested in the use of satellite observations to improve groundwater estimates in climate models.</p>

	<strong>Paul Seibert</strong><br />
	<p>Paul's research focuses on remote sensing data assimilation in the context of ecohydrology. Currently, this takes the form of using TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence data to predict evapotranspiration at a field site in Colorado.</p>
