	<p><strong>Alexis Kaminski</strong><br />
	Prof. Kaminski's research focuses on stratified geophysical and environmental flows, such as those in the ocean and atmosphere. In particular, she is interested in waves and instabilities in stratified flows, and how these flows transition to turbulence and mix the background state. She uses a range of approaches to study these problems, including numerical simulations, theory, and observations from the upper ocean. More info can be found at her <a href="https://akkaminski.github.io">website</a>.

	<p><strong>Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi</strong><br />
	Professor Gerlein-Safdi's research focuses on ecohydrology and the connections between the water and the carbon cycles in natural ecosystems. Current projects include leveraging new remote sensing techniques to map out wetlands for methane emissions modeling, effects of climate warming on fog water use by vegetation along the California coast, and the development of new methods related to solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence to understand the link between water availability and photosynthesis.
