					<p><strong>O'Brien Hall</strong>
					<p>The BEFL facilities are located in O'Brien Hall on
                            the UC Berkeley campus. The facilities in O'Brien
                            include two offices for graduate students, a
                            workshop for field equipment, and various laboratory
                            equipment including several large flumes.
							<p>O'Brien Hall is located on the North side of campus
                            next to Davis Hall, home of the Civil and
                            Environmental Engineering Department. 

							<p><strong>Engineering Laboratory for Fluid Motion in the Environment (ELFME)</strong>

						  <p>The laboratory facilities are used to provide
                            detailed measurements of environmentally relevant
                            flows in a controlled manner. The Einstein Flume is
                            a laboratory flume with a rich history, beginning
                            with professor Hans Albert Einstein work on sediment
                            transport. Today it is used for a variety of
                            research and teaching projects. Its key features
                            that distinguish it from similar flumes found in
                            most fluid labs are its length, tilting bed, and
                            sediment-handling capabilities. Its size is an
                            excellent balance between the large scales needed to
                            represent environmentally relevant flows and the
                            small scales needed to undertake controlled
                            laboratory experiments.
							<p>The Insulated Basin/Air-Sea interaction tank is a
                            double-paned water basin with an active grid wind
                            tunnel installed above it. This allows motions at
                            the wind-driven air-water interface to be measured
                            in a controlled and repeatable fashion. The
                            double-paned walls reduce thermal gradients at the
                            boundaries that can lead to undesired buoyant
                            transport, and the active grid provides a high
                            degree of adjustability in the characteristics of
                            the wind forcing.
							<p>A wave tank provides the opportunity to study waves
                            and the transport of sediment beneath them. The
                            length of the wave tank allows evolution of wave
                            forms to simulate an open ocean state before
                            breaking on the mobile-sediment beach.
							<p>A stirred turbulence tank has recently been
                            constructed. It features a very large region in
                            which turbulence is both homogeneous and isotropic,
                            and thus is an ideal facility for understanding the
                            basics of how turbulence affects transport.
							<p>A stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (2D-3C
                            PIV) system enables the measurement of
                            spatiotemporal flow dynamics using digital images of
                            flowing water. The image processing routines include
                            includes subwindow distortion and particle tracking
                            techniques, which allows measurements to be made
                            near boundaries and in highly turbulent flows. Both
                            of these cases are particularly relevant to
                            environmental flows.
							<p>The core measurement capability of PIV is augmented
                            by a variety of additional quantitative imaging
                            technology, including laser-induced fluorescence
                            (LIF) for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of
                            pollutant/nutrient transport in water flows and
                            borescope image delivery for measuring motions in
                            flows made opaque by heavy sediment loads.
